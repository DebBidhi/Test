#some of the missed concepts in the lecture 

Indexes:
Indexes are data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. They allow the database to locate and retrieve the required data more quickly, by providing an efficient way to search through large amounts of data.

Constraints:
Constraints are used to enforce rules on the data stored in a database table. They ensure that data is inserted or updated in a manner that meets certain specified criteria, such as unique values, data type and range, and referential integrity.

The "NOT NULL":
The "NOT NULL" constraint is used to enforce that a column cannot contain a NULL value. This helps to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the data stored in the database.

Transactions:
Transactions are a fundamental concept in database management, and they play a critical role in maintaining the integrity and consistency of the data stored in a database. A transaction is a sequence of one or more database operations that are treated as a single unit of work, either all of them are committed (performed), or none of them are. This helps to ensure that the database remains in a consistent state, even in the event of system failures or errors during the execution of the transaction.
